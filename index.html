        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p> Getting into development was actually a notion that really took time for me to sit with. As a college student, I knew what this profession was but I couldn't fathom all that it entailed. Once it became clear to me that web development was used in our everyday lives and that it was much more that just mathematical functions in code that I would be writing, my eyes lit up. A dear friend of mine is a Thinkful Software engineering graduate, he brought me into his day to day life, showing me all that you could do with web development and since then I have been looking forward to this career I'm pursuing.</p>
        
        <p> Aside from web development, here is a list of favorite things to do outside of my professional life:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Weight Lifting</li>
          <li>Competing in sports</li>
          <li>Wathing Netflix series</li>
          <li>Spending time with my loved ones</li>
          <li>Hanging out with my dog</li>
          <li>Eating at scenic restuarants in Miami</li>
        </ol>
